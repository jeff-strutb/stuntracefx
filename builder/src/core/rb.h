/* rb.h: the release builder's core, shared by the macOS and Windows front ends.
 *
 * The builder turns the player's own copy of Stunt Race FX into a native
 * build of the game (ports/stuntracefx: the decompilation's C on
 * nativeshvc). The code ships inside the builder, built with none of the
 * cartridge's data in it (ASSETS_DATA=file); the data comes from the
 * player's ROM, checked by MD5: the No-Intro dump of Stunt Race FX (USA)
 * (Rev 1). The build carries the ROM's assets, the bytes the game reads
 * (ports/stuntracefx/assets.csv), as romdata.bin: an image of the ROM with
 * each asset at its offset and nothing where the ROM's code was. The result
 * needs no ROM once built. It is for the system the builder runs on
 * (Windows: Windows; macOS: the Mac, or the iPhone and iPad as an .ipa).
 *
 * Paths are UTF-8 everywhere. Every long call reports progress through an
 * rb_progress and stops early (with an error) when *cancel becomes nonzero.
