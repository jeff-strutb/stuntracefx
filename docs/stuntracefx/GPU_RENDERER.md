# The cartridge's GPU renderer (design; stage 1 being built)

Every picture SRFX draws is drawn by a GPU: Metal (macOS, iOS), Vulkan
(Windows, Linux) and the PSP's GE, from one display list. The CPU runs the
game and builds the display list: meshes, matrices, materials, draw order.
It touches no pixel, no row and no projected vertex.

This covers Enhanced's pictures (the full window, the menus' 3D, two
players, Enhanced without widescreen, the pause panel) and Original's
Super FX bitmap.

## Original mode: the Super FX's bitmap on the GPU

The Super FX was the cartridge's own drawing processor. The S-CPU started
a program, waited for its STOP and sent the bitmap from the cartridge's RAM
to VRAM by DMA. The console saw three things: when a job started, how long
it took, and what the RAM held at STOP.

- **The bitmap.** The GPU draws it with the chip's own rules (edges from
  the draw list's vertices by the chip's 8.8 slopes and reciprocal table,
  texels by its u, v steps, COLOR and PLOT's options), packs it into the
  chip's bitplanes, and the CPU reads it back into the cartridge's RAM at
  STOP. Checked: byte-identical to the CPU reference at every STOP.
- **RPIX.** Every RPIX the census found in the drawing programs is a
  pixel-cache flush whose value is overwritten. The one that ends the frame
  program (01:AB7D) leaves its pixel in R0 at STOP: read from the bitmap
  read back there. FxHazeSample reads real pixels; it waits for the GPU
  (no play reaches it).
- **The job's duration.** The cartridge's statement, as the console sees
  it. It is priced from a model of what the job holds (its polygons, their
  areas and edges, flat or textured, its other primitives), refitted
  against the original's jobs (tools/stuntracefx/gsuprice.py) and the same
  on every host. Jeff's decision, 2026-11-04. Pacing then no longer matches
  HEAD byte for byte; the check is the model's accuracy against the
  original's jobs. Open: where the accesses fall within a job, for the
  S-CPU's bus holds.

## Enhanced: the split

- **CPU, once per game step (unchanged):** the S-CPU code, the Super FX's
  physics, the draw-list build and the sort. Behaviour-exact.
- **CPU, once per picture:** the tweened inputs, the view matrix and the
  sorted slots; per slot its matrix (the chip's integer algorithm), per
  face its facing and material, per command list its flow (frame picks,
  conditional lists, calls); out goes the display list.
- **GPU, per picture:** transform, near clip, projection, rasterization,
  texturing, then the ground and water, then the HUD and panels; the
  finished picture handed to nativeshvc as a GPU texture (contract asked,
  see below).

## Census (2026-11-04, nine dense scripts and race100, both modes)

Model commands reached ($cc the command byte):

| Reached | Not reached |
|---|---|
| $00 end, $04 points, $0C project, $14 faces, $1C frame pick, $20 jump, $28 if-skip, $30 facing, $38 mirrored points, $3C list start, $40 return, $44 push return, $58 list start, $5C if-call, $60 call, $64 return | $08/$4C full points, $10 depth sort, $34 scaled points, $50 sprite, $54 if-sprite, $18/$24/$2C/$48 (returns) |

- Flow reads only the facing flags at $07C6 (set by $30 from three points
  each), the model frame $0044 and its own bytes. No other RAM.
- Faces: 3 to 8 vertices; lines (n = 2) are common (1.5M in pictures),
  their second byte always 0.
- A face is drawn only when its facing byte is negative (turned to the
  eye). The BEQ after the BMI tests the INC R14 in the BMI's delay slot,
  not the byte, so a byte of 0 is skipped too (stage 2 found it; the
  census's flag counts read the wrong byte of the face record and are
  withdrawn). Face record: count, a byte not yet known, the facing-flag
  index, the material, a normal of three bytes, the vertex indices.
- $5C runs both its lists, the flag's sign choosing their order: the
  painter's switch. $28 runs the list after it then the one in line, or the
  one in line with a target deferred.
- Materials: plain 8.4M, masked (animated, bit 14) 0.30M, textured
  (bit 15) 34K, kind -2 (bits 15 and 14) none.
- Points: shift below 3 uses the packed 8-bit matrix ($0128-$0130, MULT);
  3 and up the full one ($0132-$0142, FMULT). The GPU's transform repeats
  the chip's integer steps (Metal, Vulkan); the GE's floats come within a
  unit.
- Super FX programs drawing in Enhanced's pictures: 01:AB13 (the frame
  program: objects, sprites, particles, weather, effects, text) and the
  HUD programs 07:F121, F15B, F6DF, FA88, FAF2. Step only: 07:EE88 (the
  screen fill), 07:F441 (battle), 07:F0A5.
- Not run: speed_all_courses.sfx (its `poke` step is not one nativeshvc's
  script runner takes).

Unreached commands stay supported in the decoder, each failing loudly
until a play reaches it and its check passes.

## Model cache

A command list is decoded once, on first use, per (bank, address): each
command becomes an op with its operands and its targets resolved, and each
points command a vertex block (the bytes as stored, the path: packed or
full matrix, mirrored or not). Blocks live in one GPU buffer per shape.

## Per-picture walk (CPU)

For each slot, in the sort's order (farthest first):

1. Its matrix by the chip's integer steps (FxMatrixFromAngles01, the
   transpose, the vectors), from the angles and their 1/256 fractions.
2. Its level of detail by view depth, as the frame program picks it.
3. The command list walked: frame picks from $0044, calls and returns,
   conditional lists from the facing flags. Each $30 facing test computes
   its three points' cross product from the transformed points (the
   reference's exact form in Enhanced: fw_facing_cross).
4. Faces: material resolved as FxModelMaterial does (flat, depth-shaded,
   lit, animated, textured), facing decided, index list emitted in the
   list's order.

## Drawing order and depth

Painter's order exactly as the original: slots far to near, faces in the
order their lists give. Depth is written (1/z) and never tested, so decals
and coplanar faces stay as drawn and the water pass has every pixel's
depth.

## Pixels

- Target: the canvas encoding of nshvc_ext_canvas_screen32 (0
  transparent, 1 CGRAM colour 1, 0x000000ii a CGRAM index, 0xFFrrggbb a
  colour).
- Flat faces: the index. Textured: the texel at ((v << 8 | u) & mask) +
  base in its bank, through COLOR and PLOT's rules, perspective-correct;
  on the GE a T8 texture with a palette lookup and power-of-two repeat.
- Lines, scaled sprites, particles, weather, text: GPU lines, textured
  quads and points.
- HUD pieces and panels: the game's own art as textures (the HUD
  programs' 2-bit bitmaps in bank $15, BG1's characters), placed as quads.
- The pause panel: baked textures and shaded shapes.
- Water and ground: a full-screen pass against the depth buffer.

## Contracts asked of nativeshvc (shapes approved by Jeff, 2026-11-05; not built)

None of these is built: nativeshvc dab5da4 and its lazy-console tip
(5e33c21, contract 2.20) hold none of them. The game side of the hand-off and
turning the GPU on by default wait for them. Each is new, optional and
reported by a query, so a host without it goes on as now.

1. **The canvas as a GPU texture.** `nshvc_ext_gpu_device(NshvcGpuLoan *)`
   lends the host's device and queue: Metal `id<MTLDevice>` and
   `id<MTLCommandQueue>`; Vulkan the instance, physical device, device, queue
   and queue family; 0 on a host with none. `nshvc_ext_canvas_screen_gpu(layer,
   handle, w, h, format, priority, fence)` takes the game's finished picture in
   place of `nshvc_ext_canvas_screen32`'s texels: `handle` an `MTLTexture` or a
   `VkImage` with its view, `format` the same four encodings (0 transparent, 1
   CGRAM colour 1, `0x000000ii` an index, `0xFFrrggbb` a colour) as 32-bit
   unsigned texels, `fence` an `MTLSharedEvent` value or a `VkSemaphore` the
   console waits on before it samples. The console keeps the handle until the
   next one is handed or the frame hook ends. Why: read back to the CPU and
   copied up again is the last CPU step of a picture.
2. **The PSP's present by the GE from VRAM.** `nshvc_ext_canvas_screen_ge(layer,
   vram_address, stride, w, h, psm, priority)`: the picture in VRAM, in the loan
   below, drawn straight by the console's GE list; the game's list synced before
   the frame hook returns. Why: on the PSP the picture crosses to the CPU today,
   501 ms a picture in the baseline below.
3. **The overlay from a GPU texture.** `nshvc_ext_overlay_gpu(handle, w, h,
   fence)`, as the first's handle and fence, in the place of the overlay's CPU
   texels, for the pause panel; on the PSP a VRAM address and stride as the
   second's. Why: the panel is the last picture the game draws on the CPU.
4. **The GE's loan with a depth buffer.** `nshvc_ext_ge_vram` lends 557,056
   bytes today, the canvas alone. Asked: `nshvc_ext_ge_vram2(size_t *bytes,
   void **depth, int *depth_stride)`, the same colour memory plus a 16-bit depth
   buffer of the screen's size (at most 512 x 272: 278,528 bytes), its contents
   not kept. Why: the GE's water cut on faces, sprites and quads tests each
   pixel against the water's plane written first.

## The water cut

The reference cuts a face's pixel where the water's plane is nearer on its ray.
Two causes of Aqua Tunnel's errors were found by reading the water path, fixed
on Metal and Vulkan, and not yet measured: the shaders compared a far object's
halved depth (the reference's `depth_plane` undoes the halvings, so far objects
missed the cut), and they cut lines, which the reference never does. The GE
ignores the cut on faces and sprites until the loan above; written for it under
the switch below, not run.

## The hand-off, the game's side (SRFX_NSHVC_HANDOFF: written, not linked, not run)

Off by default, and SC_GPU stays off by default. `nshvc_handoff.h` holds the
console's functions, as contract 2.22 on nativeshvc's branch `contract-2.22` gives
them (itself never run). `SRFX_NSHVC_HANDOFF=1 sh build.sh` links only against that.

- **Not handed off:** Original's job stays read back at STOP by design; on the GE its
  bitplanes are packed on the CPU, and its noise and haze are made there.
- **The bitmap pictures, the GE (Jeff, 2026-11-05: by column; two players stay at the
  game's resolution, k 2).** Each target is drawn where `nshvc_ext_canvas_chars_ge`
  reads it, so nothing is cut or copied. One player, no widescreen (26 x 16) and the
  menus (13 x 11): 8888, one band, drawn straight. Two players (two of 18 x 10): 4444,
  stride 512, 32 columns a band: 512 x 320 at 16 bits, 327,680 of the loan's 557,056
  bytes. The second target's columns 32-35 fall in the band below, so it goes in two
  passes, the draw buffer at the band's start, the offset and scissor keeping each to
  its columns: its geometry is sent twice. Jeff: if that costs too much, revisit. Its
  columns 32-35 rest on the GE clipping at the scissor pixels left of the buffer's
  column 0; not checked on the hardware. A menu's picture drawn before its flip is
  handed at the hook, or the next present draws over it: its first in set 0's place.
- **The bitmap pictures, Metal and Vulkan (Jeff, 2026-11-05: "Yes, build it").** Two
  players, the menus' 3D and no widescreen go as `nshvc_ext_canvas_chars_gpu`, the
  console placing them as ever. Each target's characters are copied by the GPU from
  the shared picture into a grid in an R8 image, one image of three in turn, the last
  target's copy making it the one that stands; handed every frame, the fence once.
  The target is cleared by the GPU. A value's high nibble needs no masking: the
  console keeps the layer's depth bits.
- **Metal, Vulkan.** The device and queue are the console's, so the GPU opens at the
  first frame hook (the renderer opens after the power on); a job before that hook,
  if any, is the chip's. The picture stays in its GPU buffers, cleared by the GPU and
  never touched by the CPU; a kernel (`widen`) makes the indices 32 bits where there
  is no ground, the GPU copies that into one of three images, and it is handed with
  a fence. A frame with no new picture hands the last again with no fence. Vulkan's
  fill needs whole words, so its texels' width is rounded up to 4 under SC_GPU.
- **The GE.** The picture stands in the loan. Its alpha is the stencil's mark while
  drawn (an index 0xFF, the ground's colour 1, colour 1 2); the GE zeroes the indices'
  and colour 1's in place and hands it. Ground colours are in the GE's own order when
  handed. A frame with no new picture hands the same address again, the console
  keeping that buffer whole while it is handed and nothing draws over it; so a
  refused redraw opens no canvas. A redraw that fails after it has drawn over that
  buffer leaves nothing to hand, and that frame shows the layer's tiles.
- **Vulkan's lent device** must have shaderInt64, which is read from its physical
  device; without it the game opens its own device and reads back to
  `nshvc_ext_canvas_screen32`. The console's frame may still be executing when the
  game submits, so each image's barrier waits on all before it on the queue.
- **The GE's water cut.** Its depth comes out 65536 k / z - 1 by the projection, k
  the true depth's factor (a far object's halvings undone, a sprite's own 1 / depth),
  so depth is 1 / depth in 16 bits. The water's plane goes in first, colour masked
  off, depth testing at or above it on faces, sprites and quads; lines, dots and
  streaks are not cut. A unit is 16 of view depth at 1024 and 256 at 4096, coarser
  than the reference's floats.
- **The pause panel (Metal, Vulkan; the PSP has no panel).** Its shapes are recorded,
  not rasterized, binned by row, and a kernel (`panel`) shades each pixel by pause.c's
  distances and blend, with the baked controller once as a buffer. Handed each frame
  it shows; the pause and play buttons stay baked overlay images.
- **Fatal under SC_GPU, outside a check:** the spans' and the ground's CPU fills, a
  job's CPU bitplanes on Metal and Vulkan, a picture or job with no GPU memory, a GE
  polygon's rows, no GPU open. The CPU's paths stand for the checks.
- **Contract 2.20 on the PSP, by reading.** The sizes pass: 338 x 224 from its 480 x
  272, no mode 5 or 6, interlace or pseudo-hires set. But a canvas at k 2 on the
  256-wide screen is fatal as the menus widen to 338 (676 past 512), and the console's
  k follows a frame or two late. Under the switch the game keeps k to what the screen
  it asked for allows (`rm_canvas_scale`, `rm_canvas_screen`). A pin moved to 2.20
  without the switch has that fatal.

## GE clipping (the GE Users Manual, chapter 10)

An earlier note here said the GE has no near clip. With clipping enabled it
clips triangles at the near plane; what it drops whole is a primitive with a
corner past 0 to 4095 after the viewport, and such primitives must be divided
first. The CPU's clip is gone: faces of objects near the eye (`sc_near`, by the
object's place and radius, no point turned) go as flat Bezier patches the GE
divides itself. A piece with a corner past the range is still dropped, very
near the eye (Jeff's decision, 2026-11-05). Not yet checked on real hardware.

## The bitmap pictures (items 3 and 4): written, compiled on Vulkan and the GE, Metal unbuilt, none run

Jeff's decisions, 2026-11-05: two players, the menus' 3D and Enhanced without
widescreen keep their layouts; Original on the PSP is drawn by the GE and is not
byte-identical there; the job-duration refit is written with placeholder
coefficients and fitted in the final pass.

What was found by reading, and what is not the GPU's yet:

- The menus' bitmap: 01:AB13 is the only program that plots into it (a car's
  label within it); no menu or object code starts another plotter. Two players:
  AB13 and, on a step's picture, the phases under RaceSoundsPlayer1 and 2 (their
  glyphs, scaled pieces and banners, quads). The gauges, digits and map markers
  are sprites, not plots.
- rows.comp and fill.comp did not walk by the chip's slopes (`edge_x` is the
  full window's exact form): polygons with FwPoly pad[0] now do, in closed form.
- A bitmap picture keeps its sprites (no solids) and has no water cut: as the
  chip's pictures always had.
- Frame rate off is not a mode of its own: `RM_OPT_FRAMERATE` is what
  `rm_enhanced()` returns, so off is Original, its pictures a job's (below). The
  option is the mode; only RM_REF_PACE (a check) runs Enhanced with no whole
  steps, and that has jobs too.
- A program whose bitmap nobody shows (`fw_silent`, fw_gsu_program's call: the
  full window up, a step's with the GPU's bitmap picture on the canvas, a menu
  frame's with its picture drawn) plots nothing and its RPIX reads 0. Everything
  else runs as ever, row loops included: its stores, registers and flags, so the
  weather's drops, the effects' and particles' records, the seed and the fill's
  scratch stay exact. Why that is safe, by reading: the S-CPU never reads R0-R14
  (only R15 is written); a pixel read goes to R0 and is overwritten at each RPIX
  but FxHazeSample's, whose table only FxHazePlot reads, to plot. Still on the
  CPU there: the program's arithmetic, its row and texel loops counting with no
  pixel made. The clear's stores stand too, RAM kept as the chip's but for pixels.
- The race's pause shows the last GPU picture: without widescreen the bitmap
  picture on the canvas as it stands. The full window's texels are another
  layout, so as it gives way (the pause, the end's fades) one GPU picture is drawn
  in the bitmap's layout from the step's start, from the frame hook, every byte
  put back (`still_try`). The VRAM copies remain only where no GPU is.
- A job's loops are primitives, none left as CPU-made spans: 07:EE88's noise a
  kernel (FW_NOISE, the CPU stepping the generator only for the seed the game
  keeps); a blit across the bitmap's wrap or past its rows one quad a piece; a
  step of 0 and the chip's 65536 rows of a count of 0 by the same quads; a thin
  polygon's row and any single PLOT a flat quad; the screen clear flat quads of
  colour 0 opaque over the columns the target holds, the bytes past it (no PLOT
  reaches them) zeroed as RAM, the stores priced as they stood. The GE takes the
  noise as 1-pixel sprites in its list (no compute) and still packs bitplanes on
  the CPU.
- Enhanced's own jobs where its bitmap is the one shown (07:EE88's course screen,
  a race's first steps before its first picture) go the same way, unpriced.
- A job at its STOP is flushed, settled by reading: every program the game starts
  that plots ends in RPIX (01:AB13, D307's text, EE88, the rising pictures, the
  glyphs and scaled sprites). Only 01:84CB, 84DA and 8515 do not, and nothing
  starts them.
- OBJ plot mode and the taller screens are never used, settled by reading: every
  CMODE takes 0, 1, 2 or a colour word's high byte, and those words are built as
  $08xx or $0Cxx (FxModelMaterial, FxSpriteMaterial), so POR bit 4 is never set;
  SCMR comes from $0374, only ever 1 or 3 (8 and 4 bits a pixel, 128 rows). Dither
  (POR bit 1) is set only by a shadow's material, and FxDrawList sets CMODE before
  any fill, so no PLOT sees it. $01:AE99-AEE1, the other clears, nothing starts.
- 07:EE88's row in the cost profile holds the whole noise in its fixed part, and
  now job.quad holds it too: the refit in the final pass must take one out.

One engine serves both: a picture in the bitmap's own coordinates times k, drawn
by the GPU to a linear 8-bit target, handed as the characters it stands for.

- **The target.** fullwindow.c's `tw`, `th`, `SXN`-`SYD` set to the bitmap's
  shape times k, the view words the game's own times k (its FW_CHECK and
  FW_KCHECK paths already draw in the bitmap's coordinates; `checking` writes
  `tex` on the CPU and must make spans instead).
- **Enhanced (k from `nshvc_ext_canvas_scale`).** `sc_frame_native` runs for
  every 01:AB13 in a picture, its `fw_view_active` widened from the one-player
  words to these. Layouts: 416 characters 8bpp (208 x 128, one player), 360 at
  4bpp (two players, `rm_canvas_show_players`), 143 at 8bpp (menus,
  `menu_flip`); all column-major (`gsu_pixel`). The linear target is cut into
  characters of 8k x 8k texels for `nshvc_ext_canvas_chars` in `picture.c`, in
  place of `rm_picture_chars`, until the hand-off. Two players walk twice, one
  target each, between `RmTweenDrawTwoPlayers`' two views. A step's own picture
  must be redrawn as `rm_race_frame` does for the full window, not taken from
  the chip's bitmap (`race_flip`, `split` stages in video/dma.c). To find by
  reading: which other programs plot into the menus' bitmap; each needs its
  quads as the HUD's have (`fw_bitmap`, or a new `ScPrim`).
- **Original (k 1).** The chip's C goes on making the draw list, exact. Every
  PLOT leaves the bitmap: FxDrawList's entries as `FwPoly` (rows.comp and
  fill.comp already walk them by the chip's slopes), the sprites' and blits'
  loops as quads (their hooks exist, gated off in Original today), lines, the
  screen clear. A new kernel packs the linear target into the chip's bitplanes;
  the bytes read back into its RAM at STOP. RPIX per the census above. No chip
  access added while off. The GE reads its target back the same way, not
  byte-identical.
- **Duration.** gsuprice.py's load model gains a form over what a job holds
  (polygons, area, edges, flat or textured, other primitives), its table's
  coefficients marked not fitted until the final pass collects the jobs.

FxHazeSample on the GPU, written, no play reaches it, shipped unproven: a marker
span (FW_HAZE) breaks the run, a kernel samples each of its 256 shape entries
(bank 8, $F92E + 4 x time) from a copy of the picture and plots them opaque; the
GE draws 1-pixel sprites from its canvas.

## Baselines (2026-11-04, SRFX 464c9dca, race100.sfx frames 1401-1500)

| Host, nativeshvc | Original: run + present = frame (ms) | Enhanced: run + present = frame (ms) |
|---|---|---|
| PSP, cc5549d | 23.218 + 17.796 = 41.253 | 125.890 + 501.508 = 627.681 |
| PSP, 2.17 (023f51a) | 24.234 + 17.712 = 42.187 | 136.301 + 501.515 = 638.118 |
| macOS null host, 2.17 | 0.330 + 1.488 | 1.999 + 2.722 |

PSP in PPSSPPHeadless with GPU_GE=1; macOS with GPU_METAL=1. Frames
1401-1500 of race100 are not all race: 1401-1430 are forced blank and the
full window's takeover, and 1431-1460 fade in (INIDISP $00 to $0F). Shots
byte-identical across the two nativeshvc versions. nativeshvc has the 2.17
slowdown's cause (its inline-access path) and is fixing it.

## Stages

Stages 1 to 3 below were each verified with numbers when made. The pixel counts
in stages 4 and 5 were measured before the native walk and are out of date;
the last measured figures (race100: Metal = Vulkan 345,208 apart, 17,348 more
than 3 pixels off; the GE 617,394, 37,113 off; Aqua Tunnel 9,131,853, 1,496,143
off) predate every change since, and nothing has been measured after them.

The frame program's pictures are walked natively (scene_frame.c, scene_walk.c
sc_walk_model): the sorted slots to the display list, facing by the determinant
over only the points each test needs, nothing projected or rejected by the CPU.
Sprites, particles and drops are ScPrim, projected by the GPU. Compiled on
Vulkan and the GE, written and not compiled on Metal, not run anywhere.

1. Geometry: the decoder and transform beside the existing redraw, each
   slot's points against the chip's ($0340 + 6i plus the object's place).
   Expected: 0 apart in the integer form.
2. Faces and order: the walk's faces and order against the draw list the
   frame program builds. Expected: 0 apart. Done (scene_walk.c,
   SC_CHECK=walk): over the nine dense scripts and race100 in Enhanced,
   29.1 million commands at the chip's own addresses and 17.9 million
   faces in its order, 0 apart; SC_BREAK shows both fail. Facing by the
   walk's own 3D determinant (no projection): the same as the chip's on
   81.5% of 19.0 million full-window tests; every one apart is the
   chip's projection failing it (points of no area at the original's
   pixels 89%, within a whole pixel's rounding of the projected points
   11%, held at the projection's limit or behind 23 tests), 0 otherwise. The renderer
   keeps the determinant; stage 4 measures the pixels it costs.
3. Materials: each face's colour or texture. Expected: 0 apart. Done
   (scene_walk.c, in SC_CHECK=walk): FxModelMaterial's rules natively
   (a shadow's colour 9, animated lists by the mask, flat, depth-shaded by
   the slot's tier, lit by the normal against the light turned into the
   object, textured: bank, colour word, base, mask, u, v list). Over the
   nine dense scripts and race100 in Enhanced, 14.0 million faces (510
   thousand textured) 0 apart, 1.82 million slots' lights and every
   slot's shade tier 0 apart; SC_BREAK shows it fails. Kind 2 met by none.
4. Pixels: the GPU's picture against the CPU reference, pixels apart and
   how far. Original shots and dumps unchanged.
5. The other passes, the menus' 3D and two players. In progress:
   - Correction (2026-11-04): until the fix below, the display list held
     only the model faces the chip clips at the screen's edges (the
     tag at l9237); the faces wholly on the screen are listed at 01:9199's
     other branch, which had no tag, so the CPU edge-walked them (race100:
     4,001 of 51,802 entries were the GPU's). The pixel counts for stage 4
     and the solids were measured with that share. Now tagged there too:
     every entry in the full window's pictures is a display-list face
     (FW_CENSUS: speed_expert_4wd 1,994,647, race100 51,802; 0 drawn by
     the CPU; 0 whose colour or bank is not its face's). Race100, all
     faces the GPU's: Metal and Vulkan 345,208 pixels apart from the CPU
     reference (273,081 a texel away, 17,348 farther), identical to each
     other; the GE 617,394 (474,791 a texel away, 37,113 farther), with
     faces near the eye or far off the sides clipped first (sc_needs_clip:
     the GE has no near clip and drops them whole). Aqua Tunnel: Metal and
     Vulkan 9,131,853 (1,496,143 farther), the cause not yet known. Earlier
     counts were too low: FW_GPUCHECK's polygon spans had lost their
     reference-only flag, so the CPU's polygons were drawn over the GPU's
     faces. Fixed.
   - Scaled sprites: one screen quad each (fullwindow.h FW_QUAD; the
     three paths of FxObjectSprite: 01:B1CB, 01:B2ED and the full window's
     own for texels not square), each pixel's texel by the chip's rule in
     integers on the GPU, the chip's row loops skipped. FW_QUADCHECK
     (each quad against the chip's loops, on the CPU): 0 texels apart over
     4,059 small, 1,989 large and 30,359 not-square quads; SC_BREAK 30,805
     apart. Metal and Vulkan: every shot identical to the chip's loops on
     the GPU's fill (541 shots, two plays; SC_BREAK: 42 differ). The GE:
     its interpolation (speed_expert_4wd: 16,607 more pixels apart over
     458 quads than the loops' rows).
   - The 2D on the GPU too, each a screen quad drawn by the GPU's own
     raster with the chip's rule per pixel: the HUD's glyphs and scaled
     sprites (07:F121, F15B, F6DF, FA88, FAF2 and every 2-bit blit: 2-bit
     bitmap quads, each kept with its piece and drawn with its join's
     shift, block-scaled by a column and row divide), the labels
     (FxTextNotice's glyphs), the panels' boxes (each box a quad from a
     texture of its pixels, made again only when the band's tiles change),
     the weather's and particles' dots and streaks (a line quad: the
     chip's Bresenham steps in closed form, 0 apart from its loop for
     every length to 300). FW_QUADCHECK: 0 texels apart over 94,846 quads
     at square texels and 106,805 not square; SC_BREAK 228,933. Metal and
     Vulkan: every shot identical to the CPU's rows on the GPU's fill.
     FW_CENSUS after: no PLOT reaches the CPU's raster in the full window.
   - The water's cut (fullwindow.c sunk) in the face shaders too (Metal,
     Vulkan), from the pixel's view depth.
   - FW_CENSUS (macOS): what the CPU still draws, by kind and routine.
     speed_expert_4wd: the HUD's programs 9.4 million plots (07:F121,
     F15B, F6DF glyphs, FA88 and FAF2 scaled sprites), labels 144,204
     (FxTextNotice), the frame program's other plots 24,052 (weather).
6. Vulkan, then the GE.
7. Original's bitmap on the GPU, read back at STOP; the job-duration model
   refitted.
8. The hand-off and the pause panel, once the contracts land; the CPU
   paths kept for checks only. The game's side written under the switch (above),
   compiled on Vulkan and the GE, Metal unbuilt, not linked, not run.
9. Cost, every host, against the baselines above.
