/*
 * fx_ground.c: the race's ground and water as a surface (plan stage 10,
 * "The ground and water"; the earlier work is be60bbb9, 8931a216..c68f1373
 * and af4032ea, remaster/fullwindow.c).
 *
 * Each course's surface is land or water, by its band's ground colours and
 * what its scenery is (the table below).
 *
 * Land, on the courses done so far (Easy Ride; Jeff, 2026-11-11, track by
 * track), is solid polygons in the course's own style: a plane at the
 * course's ground level out to the horizon and a ring of polygon mountains
 * round the course, each face shaded as the chip shades the course's own
 * lit faces ("the land as polygons", below). On the rest, until each is
 * done, land follows the course's own heights: once a course, the survey
 * (below) takes where its shapes meet the ground into a grid of heights,
 * and terrain.shade colours a few planes over it on the GPU, the land's
 * colour by distance (the band's, or the course's rock's), lit a little by
 * its slope, with the kind's marks.
 *
 * Water is a plane at the course's water level. Per picture and player it
 * is one convex polygon: the plane turned to the view
 * (the matrix at $00E4, the eye's place from the draw list), cut against the
 * near plane and the view's sides, out to where it meets the horizon within
 * a hundredth of a pixel (fx_face_triangles_whole). The GPU works out each of
 * its pixels with ground.shade: the vertices' u, v are their screen places
 * less an origin inside the polygon, and the shader's eight inputs are the
 * projective map from such a place to the plane's texels, so each pixel's
 * texel and depth are exact in perspective. Its image holds the cell of
 * marks repeated across the plane, the band's colour on each screen row
 * (the colour between the marks, as the console shows the band) and the
 * numbers the shader needs (fx_ground_image below).
 *
 * Drawn first, before the far and near objects; the ground in a range of
 * depths of its own behind all of the 3D, so the track covers it and a road
 * below it is never left out (docs/stuntracefx/native/DEPTH.md, 2); not
 * drawn while the eye is below it. Between its marks
 * the band shows through, the console's own colours; marks, as the game has
 * no ground art: on land a tuft (a 3-wide V) in two of each three 8 x 4
 * spots, on water a glint (a 4-wide dash) in one of each two, a darker shade
 * of the band's colour on their row (be60bbb9 took the band's colour 24 rows
 * nearer, which below the band's last line is the same colour), on cells
 * the size of Aqua Tunnel's ripple cells, left out where a texel is smaller
 * than an output pixel.
 *
 * Aqua Tunnel's water is its underwater backdrop's art (video's
 * race_underwater_cells): the nearest row of ripple cells, 64 x 16 texels,
 * repeated across the plane; each ripple in the colour its strip's rows
 * take at the pixel's depth (a strip row's commonest colour, the rows'
 * depths as the original shows them, WATER_DEPTH); the water between them
 * the band's colour on the row, drawn, not left to show through; where an
 * output pixel spans more than a texel, the ripples go to their mean cover.
 * Its water cuts the picture (fx_face_cut): what lies past it from the eye
 * is drawn before it, the rest after, so from above the glass tube is under
 * the water and from inside the tube the water is overhead; where a track
 * piece crosses the water the water has a hole the size of the piece's
 * crossing, and what lies past the water shows through it (the road going
 * down inside its tunnel). In the sealed tunnel (bit 3 of $0DA5) there is
 * no water (the earlier water's; the ocean, below, is drawn there too).

   is down). Land takes its heights from the course's own shapes (the
   survey below). None: the checkered test arenas. Sky Ramp (its band is
   sky all the way down, the track meant to float) has a sea of clouds
   under it (the clouds, below). The airport is the
   night city (Jeff). Water is at the height where its lowest road's pieces
   end (a road piece reaches 640 below the road), measured from the
   course's shapes, so the road stands in it and nothing of the road hangs
   above it. Land with a shade class (cls, a class of the chip's lit faces'
   shade rows; for water `under` the class seen from below, the eye under
   the water) is drawn as polygons in that class's shades (the land as
   polygons, below); the rest as before, until each course is done (Jeff,
   2026-11-11: track by track, Easy Ride first). A flat course's land is
   the plane alone, with no ring of mountains round it: a city, whose
   skyline is on its backdrop at the horizon, which mountains would hide.
   A forest course's land has the course's own trees standing round it
   (the forest, below).

   The battle courses ($10-$13) are drawn by two players, whose palettes
   hold no shade rows (their colours $10-$FF are the two players' sixteen-
   colour rows: a class's row reads blacks, reds and yellows), so their
   land and water take their bands' own colours, all of them

   players' bands reading the same lists). The stunt arenas ($0C-$0F) keep
   their floors as they are (Jeff, 2026-11-12): the floor is what the car

/* ---- the ground's heights: the course's own shapes ----

   Once a course, every course object's model points in world space,
   through the chip's own object walk: each record alone in the first slot,
   placed a little ahead of an eye whose view matrix ($00E4) is the
   identity, its points caught as the frame program projects them
   (fx_face_survey), nothing drawn (fx_draw_hold), the chip's RAM and state
   put back after. Sprites, effects and objects placed in view space are
   left out; of each shape only its lowest part counts, the points within
   FOOT of its lowest (a pillar's foot, a road's surface, a wall's base).
   The near records are in view space after the sort (turned back by the
   matrix's rows), the far ones from the view in 32 bits. A grid of cells
   takes in each the lowest point that falls in it (world y is down: the
   largest), where the shapes meet the ground; cells with none take the
   nearest such cell's height, then are smoothed from their neighbours, the
   known cells held and the grid's edge free, so past the course the land
   goes on at the height of the course beside it (no height of its own
   pulls it up or down). Its rock, from the course's own untextured faces
   as the chip queues them: the colour with the most area on steep faces
   (cliffs, mesas, banks) and the palette entries next to it that its
   faces also use, the rock's shades (the canyons' are runs of four or five
   reds and browns, the shade baked into each face by the way it faces);
   their order by brightness, and how a face's shade goes with the way it
   faces, fitted by least squares over those faces (shade = light . n +
   bias, n its outward normal), so that rock land at any slope takes the
   shade the course gives a rock face facing that way. */

/* ---- the tunnels' rock (Jeff, 2026-11-11: "give it rocky sides") ----

   A tunnel piece's model is its inside only (roof, walls, lights): seen
   from the side, across open ground, its inside showed. Found by the
   survey's records (Sunset Valley's, dumped 2026-11-11: seven of shape
   $E384, 3,840 x 3,903 and 960 high, a roof's area (16.6 million) and two
   walls' (6.6), nothing facing up; one $E480 the same with its lights): a
   piece no more than TUNNEL_HIGH high, at least TUNNEL_WIDE across both
   ways, the area facing down (outward) at least half its box's ground and
   the area facing sideways at least a quarter of that. Its open ends are
   where no walls face: across x when its walls face x. Each gets a shell
   of rock: walls from the ground (the plane, or its floor where that is
   lower) widening out by a third of their height, SHELL_THICK outside its
   walls, and a ridged roof SHELL_THICK above its ceiling, open at both
   ends; drawn right after the piece's own faces in the 3D's order (at its
   depth: 0, or a far object's), and only the faces that look at the eye,
   so from outside the tunnel is rock with its mouths in it and from inside
   nothing changes. Shaded as the mesas are. What the 3D draws after the
   piece (a car inside it nearer the eye than it) still shows over its
   rock. */

   none): its shades' colours, darkest first (the palette entries as shown
   now), from word 8 the light's three numbers, the bias and the count of
   shades; the grid's heights from T_GRID, nx a row. Land other than rock is in the band's
   colour on the row a flat ground at the course's level (grid.level) shows
   its depth on, below the 3D's horizon (fx_draw_horizon_now) at the pixel's

/* ---- the land as polygons: a plane to the horizon and a ring of mountains ----

   Jeff (2026-11-11): the ground as clear solid polygons in the style of the
   course's own design, out to the horizon with no gaps. Courses whose
   surface names a shade class (the table's cls; Easy Ride first, the rest
   track by track) draw their land so; the rest as above.

   The ground is one plane at the course's level (grid.level), from under
   the eye out to where it meets the horizon within HORIZON_GAP of an output
   pixel in every direction, so nothing of the backdrop shows below the
   horizon. It is never above the eye: where the eye is lower than
   EYE_CLEAR over the level (a tunnel), it lies EYE_CLEAR under the eye, so
   it is never seen from below. Round the course, unless it is flat (the
   table's flat: Night Owl), stands a ring of MOUNTAINS pyramids of SIDES
   faces, made once a course from the survey's footprint
   (their places, sizes and shapes from a hash of the course and their
   number; their size in proportion to the footprint's), each base wholly
   GAP of the footprint's half size outside it, so no mountain can stand
   between the eye and the course's shapes; their bases on the plane.

   Each face is shaded as the chip shades a lit face of a course's model
   (FxModelMaterial): its light level its normal against the light (fixed in
   view space), floored and kept to 6-15; its colour the byte at that level
   in the class's shade row, the nearest tier's (bank 3, SHADE_ROWS); and
   that byte's colour in the palette (two players' pictures, whose palette
   is in 16-colour rows: the course's own colour, course_day_colour, as one
   player's picture has it; the fixed palette at $1F:8800 is only some
   courses' own, Night Owl's matching it in 48 of its 240 colours). The level's scale and
   sign come from the survey's fit of the course's own lit faces
   (grid.light_k), so the land takes the shades the course's own faces take
   facing the same way.

   Depths (docs/stuntracefx/native/DEPTH.md, 2): the plane lies at the
   median of where the course's shapes meet the ground, so much of the
   course is below it: it is in the ground's depths, behind all of the 3D.
   The mountains and mesas stand outside the course on it, at the world's
   true depths (each corner's own 1 / Z), so they hide each other, and the
   course where they stand in front of it, as they stand. Triangles: the plane's quad (2, at most 6 once kept
   to the view) and MOUNTAINS x SIDES faces (50), those facing away left
   out. No image and no shader: the GPU fills each in its colour. */

/* ---- the forest: the course's own trees round it ----

   Jeff (2026-11-12, King's Forest): "It says 'forest' so you should place
   a ton of the trees around the terrain too." The trees are the course's
   own, copied (fx_solid_forest_tree): none until the race has drawn one
   of its trees near, trunk and canopy together.

   They stand only outside the course's footprint, their feet at least
   FOREST_CLEAR beyond it past their canopies' half width, so none stands
   on the course or, from the game's camera (in the footprint's box: it
   trails the car by far less than FOREST_CLEAR, and no line from a point
   in a box to another leaves it), between the eye and it. On a lattice a canopy's width a step, each place moved
   by up to FOREST_JITTER of a step (a hash of the course and the place),
   left out where the groves' noise (value noise on a lattice of
   FOREST_GROVE steps) is under FOREST_OPEN, a clearing; of those the
   FOREST_MOST nearest the footprint are kept, so the forest is a belt as
   deep as that many trees make it; each 0.85 to 1.2 the course's tree's
   size, its foot on the ground (the plane's level, or a mountain's face
   over it, the highest) sunk by its trunk's half width, so none stands on
   a slope with its foot in the air.

   Drawn after the plane and the mountains as instanced meshes (nshvc
   6.2, fx_solid_forest_*), every tree the course's 3D tree at the detail
   its size asks, placed and projected on the GPU at the world's true
   depths (exact per pixel), so they and the mountains hide what stands
   behind them, and the plane, in the ground's depths, lies behind them all; in FOREST_BLOCK x
   FOREST_BLOCK lattice blocks, a block left out whole where its sphere is
   behind the eye or past FOREST_WIDE of the view's sides. One player's
   pictures only (two players' keep the course's trees as sprites, and so
   the land none). */

   CITY_LOT, a building on it from CITY_KINDS shapes (walls and a roof, a

   more past the footprint (so nothing of it stands on the course or, from
   the game's camera in the footprint's box, between the eye and it: no
   line from a point in a box to another leaves it) and none past
   CITY_REACH. Each shape is an instanced mesh (nshvc
   6.2), written again only when its colours change, each building one
   instance of it, its size its lot's 0.8 to 1 (a size is uniform, so the
   shapes give the proportions), drawn at the world's depths nearest first,

/* ---- the clouds ----

   Jeff (2026-11-12, Sky Ramp: "Sea of clouds"): the track floats in the
   sky, its band sky all the way down. Under it a sea of clouds: the land's
   plane CLOUD_BELOW under the lowest place the course's shapes reach (the
   survey's deepest), out to the horizon, in the class's level face's
   colour, and on it cloud banks, each a few domes (puffs) of CLOUD_SEGS
   sides and CLOUD_RINGS rings, flat at the base on the plane, from
   CLOUD_KINDS shapes; a bank to a cell of CLOUD_CELL (CLOUD_EMPTY of the
   cells none), set off in it by up to a third of a cell, 0.6 to 1 of
   CLOUD_BASE, out to CLOUD_REACH past the footprint. A bank's top stays
   under the course's lowest place (its shapes at most 0.31 of their size
   high, CLOUD_BASE 0.31 = 2,790, less than CLOUD_BELOW less CLOUD_TOP_GAP),
   so with the eye above that place no line from it to the course passes
   through a bank, and banks may lie under the course as well as round
   it. A face's colour is the chip's for a lit face
   of the class facing as it does in the view (the light is fixed in view
   space, so the same for every bank: one colour a face, the mesh written
   again when one changes; a mesh set for each picture being made,
   fx_draw_mesh_slot, so a picture shown keeps the colours written for
   it). Each shape an instanced mesh (nshvc 6.2), each bank one instance
   of it, drawn at the world's depths nearest first, a bank whose sphere is
   outside the view left out. Triangles: a puff CLOUD_SEGS (2 CLOUD_RINGS -

/* ---- the ocean: a plane of facets, partly see-through, over a sea bed ----

   Jeff (2026-11-11): Aqua Tunnel an ocean with a polygonal water effect, a
   shader allowed, simple and clear, in the game's look. The water is one
   plane at the course's water level out to the horizon (as the land's), at
   the world's true depths, drawn after the solid 3D, tested and not
   written (fx_draw.c fx_draw_water), with holes where the road goes down
   (fx_face_cut). ocean.shade draws it as a lattice of OCEAN_CELL facets, each lattice
   point rising and falling OCEAN_WAVE of a cell, each facet shaded as the
   chip shades a lit face in the course's water class (the image's texels
   0-9: the class's colours at levels 6-15, texel 10 the flat sea's), the
   facets giving way to the flat sea where they are smaller than a pixel;
   partly see-through, the more the steeper the eye looks down, whole toward
   the horizon. It is drawn as the earlier water was (fx_draw_surface): its
   vertices' u and v their screen places less an origin inside it, and no
   depth divisor (a divisor, for u and v in perspective, came back from the
   GPU's divide a rounding off the 3D's depth and the water showed through
   the road in speckles, Jeff's picture of 2026-11-11); the shader's inputs
   are the projective map from a screen place to the water in cells (the
   eye's place taken modulo OCEAN_PERIOD cells, the lattice's pattern, so
   the numbers stay small), its other numbers in its image.

   From below (the eye under the water: the glass tube) it is whole, and it
   is drawn in the sealed tunnel too, so that the original's underwater
   backdrop shows nowhere: the water overhead, the sea bed below.

   Under it a sea bed, so that nothing of the backdrop shows through the
   water: a plane SEABED_BELOW under the lowest place the course's shapes
   meet the ground (or the water), opaque, in the class's darkest colour
   darkened to SEABED_DARK, at the world's true depths, under all of the
   course.
