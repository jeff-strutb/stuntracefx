/*
 * fx_solid.c: sprites that show solid things drawn as solid shapes (plan
 * stage 10, solids; the design of src/stuntracefx/remaster/solids.c, as
 * approved there). Some of the race's objects are pictures facing the
 * view, drawn by FxObjectSprite with the picture picked for the angle they
 * are seen at: every car's tyres (shape $A1C8), the bonus course truck's
 * wheels ($A1E4), every car's eyes ($A190, near or far) and the trees' trunks and
 * canopies ($A104, $A120; Night Cruise's bushes $A0E8). Each is drawn in
 * its place as a solid instead:
 *
 *   tyres, wheels   a shape turned about its axle (a profile of rings, the
 *                   ends capped and ringed), at the object's place in view
 *                   space, turned as the model drawer turns a model with
 *                   the object's angles, its faces flat in the colours its
 *                   pictures use, a side's shade by how far it faces up;
 *   eyes            a half dome, its flat face ahead, turned by the byte
 *                   its sprite's picture is picked by (the objects' gaze:
 *                   the lens to the view at 119.5, side on at 55.5, 64 a
 *                   quarter turn), level; its face its look's picture
 *                   facing the view drawn as marks: plain ($9AAF),
 *                   startled ($9AB1), lidded ($9AB3, $9AB7) or shut
 *                   ($9AB5); an eye with no gaze (its fixed picture) stays
 *                   its sprite;
 *   trees           the trunk and the canopy each turned about the world's
 *                   upright, their widths from their paintings, the
 *                   canopy's points moved a little in and out and up and
 *                   down (the same for every tree), so its facets take the
 *                   light each its own way; each face's colour one of its
 *                   painting's by how far it faces the light the painting
 *                   is lit from; Night Cruise's bushes ($A0E8) a canopy
 *                   alone, to the ground (Jeff, 2026-11-12: every course's
 *                   2D trees our 3D trees; a census of the sprites every
 *                   course leaves flat and of the objects its records
 *                   place found no other tree: $A104/$A120 on Easy Ride
 *                   and King's Forest, $A0E8 on Night Cruise).
 *
 * The sprite's code runs as ever (its state, its clipping, its colour);
 * only its quads are left out (fx_solid_hiding). The solid's faces are
 * points in view space, projected and clipped by fx_face_triangles and
 * filled by the GPU. Effects stay sprites. In two players' pictures (four
 * bits a pixel, their colours one palette row's) the tyres and wheels take
 * one player's colours, entries of palette row 14, which the battle palette
 * has the same; the eyes take the battle row's colours at the same places
 * (its body blue, its white and black are one player's at those places);
 * the trees keep their sprites.
 *
 * In a shape's own coordinates x is across, y down and z ahead.

/* ---- the land's forest (fx_ground.c): copies of the course's tree ----

   Jeff (2026-11-12): King's Forest's land with "a ton of the trees", the
   course's own. A course's tree is two sprites, its trunk ($A104) and its
   canopy ($A120), each its own object at its own place. The first tree
   the race draws whose trunk
   and canopy stand together in one picture (the canopy's middle above the
   trunk's and within a quarter of the canopy's width of the trunk's
   upright, the nearest such) gives the land's tree: the two paintings and
   their colours' row, each part's size (world units a painting texel) and
   where the canopy's middle is from the trunk's in the world. A land tree
   is that, k times the size, at the detail a course tree of that size
   there would be drawn at (tree_detail): its model at that level (the
   course's own, tree_level) is an instanced mesh (nshvc 6.2), made once a
   level, its faces' colours set for the picture's view as tree_body sets
   a face's (its normal in view space against the painting's light), and
   every tree at that level one instance of it, placed and sized on the
   GPU (fx_solid_forest_end). A far tree's parts (their places halved for
   the far list, fx_far.c) pair as a near one's, their places and sizes
   doubled back, unless its size was its own, not halved with its place. */

   Each part's (1 the trunk, 2 the canopy) model at each detail level (its
   sides level and rings level, tree_level's), in its painting's texels
   about its middle along the world's axes (x and z across, y down, as
   tree_point places it), is a mesh: one for each picture being made
   (fx_draw_mesh_slot), so a picture shown keeps the colours written for its
   own view. A mesh's room is its level's most: (rings - 1) x sides x 2
   triangles, the rings at most a painting's rows by the level's step, two
   ends more. A picture's trees are gathered by part and level
   (fx_solid_forest_add) and each level used is written and drawn once
   (fx_solid_forest_end).

   Its cost on the GPU is its triangles and the pixels they cover, so a
   land tree is no finer than it shows (Jeff, 2026-11-12, on the forest at
   the course trees' detail: "framerate is pretty heavily hit ... heavily
   optimize"): the course trees' detail keeps a part's outline within half
   an output pixel of round and its rings 1.5 pixels apart, which made a
   far tree's triangles a pixel or two each, about a million of them a
   picture; a land tree's level keeps its outline within FOREST_FLAT_PX and
   its rings FOREST_RING_PX apart (forest_detail), a part under
   FOREST_LEAST_PX across its half width is left out (a far tree's trunk
   first), a part whose sphere is wholly outside the view's rectangle or
   behind the eye is left out, and each level's instances are drawn
   nearest first, the canopies before the trunks, so the GPU's depth test
   throws away what lies behind them before shading it. */
