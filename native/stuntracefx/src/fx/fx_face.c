/*
 * fx_face.c: the race's shapes in floats (plan stage 10, "Stage 10's 3D").
 *
 * The frame program decides what is drawn: which objects, which level of
 * detail, which faces face the eye, their order and materials. Where it is
 * drawn is made here, from the view-space points, unrounded and unheld:
 *
 *   FxModelProject   each point's view-space sum (the model's point at
 *                    $0340 + 6i plus the object's place at $0026-$002A, in
 *                    16 bits as the chip adds them) is kept by its record
 *                    $04E4 + 6i (fx_face_point);
 *   FxModelFaces     each face that faces the eye: its points and texels
 *                    (fx_face_begin, fx_face_vertex), then its material
 *                    (fx_face_end), which makes its shape;
 *   FxDrawList       the shapes drawn in order (fx_draw.c).
 *
 * The chip's own clip, projection to whole pixels and queue are not used:
 * whether a face is seen is decided here, in floats.
 *
 * A shape is the face clipped against a near plane in view space,
 * projected x = cx + 128 X / Z, y = cy + 128 Y / Z, clipped against the
 * view's rectangle, and fanned. A textured face is cut by planes of equal
 * depth until each piece's far over near depth is at most 1.25, so each
 * piece's texture, laid on by the GPU across the screen, stays near its
 * place in space. Nothing here makes a pixel.

   The chip turns a model's points in fixed point (command $04's, below
   detail 3, by a matrix packed into bytes) and rounds each sum to a whole
   unit, and halves a far object's place and turn besides, so faces on one
   plane come out up to 3 apart. Each corner is made again here in double
   from what the chip made it from: the point as its point command read it
   (fx_face_source: its bytes times the model's scale, or its words), turned
   by the object's turn (its angles with their fractions, the rows the
   chip's FxMatrixFromAngles01 makes of them, transposed; flag $2000 takes
   the world's up out after it, as the chip flattens a shadow) and the
   view's (the same rows of the view's angles at $00DE), plus the object's
   place from the eye in the world's axes (its draw record's, whole:
   fx_far_exact_place) turned by the view. The view's turn is taken only
   while the chip's own at $00E4 is it, within VIEW_STEPS of its 32768ths:
   the ground's survey draws with its own (the identity, thousands off).
   The chip's own is the same view with its arithmetic's error
   (FxMatrixFromAngles01): each sine and cosine from a 256-step table
   interpolated in a straight line, at most 2.5 of its 32768ths short of
   the curve, and the table's rounding half more; an entry is two products
   of up to three of them, each product rounded, so up to 19 off. VIEW_STEPS
   was 8: a picture in 21 to 43 had an entry 8 to 10.8 off (the race in
   both views, 2026-11-13: logged 4,877 pictures), its objects then all
   drawn from the chip's rounded corners, the cars unseated and dropped a
   tyre's radius into the road for that picture. An object whose place is

   merged pass's order), so the track under them is known: the collision
   models of the pieces drawn, the ground the game drives them on
   (fx_track.c), never a face only drawn on or near it. Each tyre is moved
   along the normal of the ground under its middle to its radius over it
   (fx_face_seat_tyre); the car's other
   parts are moved by its tyres' mean move; and a face of the car whose
   corners then all lie no more than SHADOW_OVER of a tyre's radius over
   the ground under its middle (the shadow: its two faces measured 39 to 58
   under the tyres' middles, tilted with the car; the body's lowest 15 and
   its one level face, the roof, 130 over) is laid on that ground, each
