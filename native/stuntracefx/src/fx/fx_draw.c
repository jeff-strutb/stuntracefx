/* ---- seen through: what hides the player's car ----

   Jeff, 2026-11-13, on the overhead view: "make track/terrain entities that
   are 'above' the car - such as going under a bridge or in a tunnel - semi
   transparent while under them so you can still see the car", and "the
   fade should be like a sufficiently/playably sized 'radius' around the
   player car so the entire entity doesn't go transparent just where that
   radius is, with the radius smoothly fading back to opaque at the edges".

   While a view has a focus (the player's car: race/overhead.c) and the
   game's fade shader is in, what the frame program draws is in pieces
   (fx_draw_piece): each object one (fx_face.c, by its object; the cars
   none), the land's mountains one and its fill one (fx_ground.c), each
   instance of the land's trees, buildings and clouds one
   (fx_draw_mesh_seen). A piece hides the car when the line from the eye
   to one of SEE_POINTS points on the car (the middle of its body; the
   middle of its roof and four points SEE_SIDE round it, across the screen
   and along the ground) passes through one of its triangles SEE_MARGIN or
   more short of the point: on the screen, the point inside the triangle,
   the triangle's depth there (z, linear across it) nearer than the
   point's. A piece's fade rises from 0 to 1 over SEE_TIME while it hides
   the car and falls back while it does not, kept by what it is known by
   (its object; the land's by what it is and where it stands), so nothing
   comes or goes at once.

   Once the world is drawn (fx_draw_world_end), each triangle of a piece
   with a fade is cut at the level plane SEE_ABOVE over the car's place
   (along the world's up), in view space from its corners' depths (each
   corner's place on the screen at its depth; what a corner carries is
   linear along an edge in space): the part under it is drawn where it was,
   the part over it after the rest of the world, farthest first, tested
   against the depth and not written (the car and all that lies behind the
   piece are drawn by then and show through it), through fade.shade: its
   own colour shown in quarter steps, as the rest of the game's art is
   (Jeff, 2026-11-13: "it should be stepped since the rest of the game is in
   that art style as well"): within SEE_INNER of SEE_RADIUS (at the car's
   depth) of the car on the screen, SEE_LEAST mixed toward whole by its
   fade, to the nearest quarter, or nothing of it for the ground (the
   land's pieces: its mountains, fill and tunnels' rock, and the water;
   Jeff, 2026-11-13: "Unlike structures, you need to make ground terrain
   fully transparent in the radius (stepped of course). It's too confusing
   otherwise"); from there to SEE_RADIUS in rings of equal width, each
   quarter between that and whole; whole past it. A quarter is
   a whole number of a pixel's samples on every GPU (1 of 4, 2 of 8), so
   each step is exact. A road or floor under the car stays whole, and of
   what hides it only what lies near it on the screen is seen through. The
   ocean's water, drawn by a shader of its own, is a piece known as
   FX_PIECE_WATER that hides the car when its plane lies between the eye
   and the car (fx_draw_see_plane, Jeff, 2026-11-13: "you aren't making
   terrain like water transparent too when under them"): its shader steps
   it the same way, never showing more than the water itself does. */

   a face is drawn one layer in front of the highest earlier face of the

   same share a layer, so a road cut into pieces does not climb. It lies on
   an earlier face when they face the same way and each of its corners is
   within LAYER_TOL (and LAYER_REL of its distance) of that face's plane:
   the corners are exact (fx_face.c), so faces the game made on one plane
   meet that to the double's rounding, and two real surfaces are always
   farther apart. Overlap is their triangles' on the screen, with a
   thousandth of a pixel's edge, so faces that only touch (a chequered
