/*
 * overhead.c: the race seen from above (Jeff, 2026-11-12: a camera like the
 * near-isometric view of Mini Motor Racing, "just the camera angle
 * changes"; chosen with SRFX_CAMERA=overhead in the environment). On the
 * first look, from 60 degrees down and 5,000 away: "too top down and too
 * close. No sense of the track ahead or behind ... more of an isometric
 * angle, kind of like RC Pro Am but better". On the isometric angle
 * (2026-11-13): "make the perspective angled down more so the player can
 * see what's coming up ahead better", meaning down the track, toward what
 * lies ahead; at 45 degrees: "You're still top down, not isometric angled
 * down to see ahead on the track", and of a camera that turns with the car
 * or stays fixed and shallower, "Stay fixed, shallower".
 *
 * Only the pictures change. The game's camera still runs as before and
 * everything that reads it (the trigger lists, the objects' activation,
 * traffic, sound) reads it as before: the overhead view is put in place of
 * the game's in a picture's part between steps (RaceViewForPicture, whose
 * state fx_tween puts back after the picture), never in a step.
 *
 * The view looks down at OVERHEAD_PITCH, 25 degrees (the isometric angle,
 * 35.26, and 45 before), and across the course's
 * grid at 45 degrees (the heading the player's car starts the race in, to
 * the nearest quarter turn, less an eighth turn: the course's straights lie
 * on the screen's diagonals and the car first drives up and to the right),
 * fixed for the whole race, its centre on the player's car from
 * OVERHEAD_DISTANCE away, through a lens OVERHEAD_ZOOM times as long as
 * the chip's (the 3D magnified about the view's centre, fx/fx_view.h).
 * At a 16:9 window the screen spans 19.8 degrees top to bottom, the view's
 * centre 8.6 of them under its top, so the ground it shows runs from 16.4
 * to 36.3 degrees below level: about 14,600 of the world's units deep
 * (8,900 past the car, up the screen, and 5,600 before it; at the
 * isometric angle 5,600 and 4,600, at 45 degrees 4,300 and 4,000) and
 * 10,600 across at the car, a thing at the screen's top about 2.1 times
 * smaller than one at its bottom (1.6 at the isometric angle); the car
 * (about 290 across) a thirty-fifth of the screen's width. The course's
 * straights lie on the screen's diagonals, so what lies ahead is up the
 * screen while the car drives up it.
 *
 * The distance takes the view past what the game's 16-bit places hold: the
 * eye is kept whole (FxView.eye; g's view place is its low 16 bits, from
 * which a near record's place, within 27,000 of it, is exact in 16 bits),
 * and an object whose place from the eye passes 14 bits is drawn halved
 * with its size, as the far objects are (fx_far.c): the same picture.
 *
 * What the game's view gave the picture besides its place is kept as the
 * game's: the chip's light is fixed in its view, so it is turned with the
 * pitch (a face takes the shade it takes in the game's level view of the
 * same heading: the road's tops the game's, not the brightest); a model's
 * detail and haze go by its depth scaled so the car's is the race camera's
 * (OVERHEAD_GAME_DISTANCE from it); and the far objects are drawn among
 * the near ones by depth, since the near list is the cells ahead of the
 * game's camera, not those nearest this one.
 *
 * One player only: two players' halves and the course menu's race keep
 * the game's view.
 *
 * The switch (Jeff, 2026-11-13: "Add a button next to the pause button to
 * switch between traditional behind car mode and isometric mode", "do a
 * seamless visual transition (over 2s) between the two modes when
 * switching, pausing the gameplay while it does", "disable traditional cam
 * switch buttonw hile in isometric mode since it does nothing"). The view
 * button (pause.c beside the corner button, input/controls.c beside the
 * touch screen's) switches it in a one-player race; the player's choice is
 * kept in the options (option_overhead), SRFX_CAMERA=overhead starting it
 * from above. A switch holds the game SWITCH_UPDATES updates (2 seconds):
 * its logic and its steps' clock stop as the pause screen stops them, and
 * its picture is drawn as it stood, from a view moving between the two:
 * the eye's place from the car, its distance by its logarithm and its
 * direction along the great circle; the view's angles, each the shorter
 * way round; the lens's magnification by its logarithm (the chip's window
 * words with it); the light turned by that share of the pitch; and the
 * models' detail scaled toward the overhead view's, all eased in and out
 * (smoothstep). Each end is the view itself. While it is from above,
 * Select's step through the game's own camera points (CameraPointFromTable)
 * is not taken (object/gsu_record.c): it would change nothing seen.
